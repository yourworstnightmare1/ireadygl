# Welcome to iReadyGL
iReadyGL allows you to play i-Ready games that require coins for free.
## How does this work?
All it does is load the game off of the [i-Ready CDN server](https://cdn.i-ready.com) as loading the game doesn't require any special token or key to access.
# Install
Install the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/yourworstnightmare1/ireadygl/releases).
