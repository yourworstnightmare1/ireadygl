# Welcome to iReadyGL
iReadyGL is a simple GUI-based HTML page allows you to play i-Ready games that require coins for free.
## How does this work?
All it does is load the game off of the [i-Ready CDN server](https://cdn.i-ready.com) as loading the game doesn't require any special token or key to access. We just sort it in some fancy UI.

# Compatability
You can only run iReadyGL from **Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Edge**, and **Safari**.

# Install Guide
## Windows/macOS
1. Go to the `irgl-stable-release.zip` file in Downloads or your predefined download location. Right-click or Ctrl+Click. Select "Extract all..." and also select this for any popup message.
2. Open the new `irgl` folder and open the `irgl.html` file.

## iPadOS
1. Go to **Files > Downloads** and locate the `irgl-stable-release.zip` and open it. The file will auto-extract with no popups.
2. Open the new `irgl` folder and open the `irgl.html` file.
