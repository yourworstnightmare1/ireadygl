# Welcome to iReadyGL
iReadyGL is a simple GUI-based HTML page allows you to play i-Ready games that require coins for free.
## How does this work?
All it does is load the game off of the [i-Ready CDN server](https://cdn.i-ready.com) as loading the game doesn't require any special token or key to access. We just sort it in some fancy UI.

# Compatability
You can only run iReadyGL from **Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Edge**, and **Safari**.
